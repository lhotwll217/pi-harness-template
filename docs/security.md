# Security

> **Status:** Implemented across the four controls: the pinned
> `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system` reconciled from owner settings, protected
> paths, the `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` adapter with its fail-closed
> verification probe (`src/agent/sandbox`), and headless approval denial in the
> scheduled-prompt runner.

Security is not one feature. The harness keeps four independent controls visible
because each answers a different question:

| Control | Question |
|---|---|
| Capability posture | Which tools and operations exist for this run? |
| Approval policy | Is an attempted call allowed, denied, or subject to owner approval? |
| Privacy policy | Which paths, repositories, credentials, and data are protected? |
| OS enforcement | What can the process actually access through files, subprocesses, and the network? |

Passing one layer never proves that another layer is enforced. Documentation and
diagnostics must not call a permission decision a sandbox.

## Interactive and headless authority

Interactive runs may ask the owner when policy allows. Headless runs cannot
manufacture consent: an operation that would require approval in an interactive
session is denied unless a separately reviewed headless policy grants it.
Scheduled runs also narrow their capability catalog to the tools declared by the
schedule snapshot.

## Explicit resource loading

The Pi runtime must begin with ambient context, prompts, skills, and extensions
disabled. It then loads a harness-owned ordered catalog plus explicitly approved
workspace resources. A task working directory may carry trusted task policy, but
its mere presence does not make arbitrary executable extensions safe.

## Protected paths

Path policy must reason about explicit paths, traversal, symlinks, filesystem
resolution, and repository identities. Direct file-tool guards are useful but do
not constrain process-internal access from a shell command. OS enforcement owns
that stronger boundary.

Secrets remain under the harness home or provider store and must not appear in
logs, readiness output, transcripts, events, or error messages.

## Sandbox adapter boundary

The sandbox is a replaceable platform adapter behind a small contract. The
contract should express filesystem, process, and network policy and provide a
model-free verification probe.

The adopted provider is `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` (Apache-2.0), wrapping
macOS Seatbelt and Linux bubblewrap behind one API. It is pinned exactly and
treated as disposable behind the adapter contract: the package is pre-1.0 and
published from an experimental organization, so the contract — not the provider
— is the durable architecture. Adoption is gated on an escape-boundary review
at port time. There is no stub fallback: if enforcement cannot be verified by
the model-free probe, the onboarding sandbox stage fails closed rather than
completing with a warning.

## Audit and provenance

Every model or command run should retain enough provenance to identify its
session, caller, task directory, schedule/run when applicable, effective
capability set, and policy version. Provenance supports diagnosis and audit; it
must not duplicate secrets or become a competing source of durable truth.

## Open decisions

- The stable adapter contract around the adopted
  `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system` extension.
- Network defaults for interactive and scheduled work.
- How owner-authored task policy may narrow or widen the global baseline.
